# Moodle HTML5 audio/video to MP4 filter

This filter allows the automated creation of MP4 sources for HTML5 `<audio>` and `<video>` elements.

This is particularly useful if some users are using [atto_recordrtc](https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/RecordRTC) because most browsers create `ogg` files for audio and `webm` files for video, which are not playable in Safari.

This plugin then checks for the existence of an `mp4` source in the same file area and provides it automatically if it exists. In the case the `mp4` source does not exist, it is created via a scheduled task.

## Requirements

A working `ffmpeg` installation, and the correct path to be set in the plugin settings.

In Debian-like GNU/Linux environments, `ffmpeg` can be installed by issuing the following command:

```
apt-get install ffmpeg
```

## Installation

You need to at least:

1. install `ffmpeg` (see above),
2. set the `pathtoffmpeg` in the plugin settings.

Optionnally you can:

* change the other plugin settings as required,
* tweak the execution times of the scheduled task running the file conversions.

Hints:

* Read https://docs.moodle.org/en/Managing_filters how to activate and order filters.
* The order in which the **HTML5 audio/video to MP4 filter** is placed has an effect on its correct working (whether it converts or not). 
* The filter **HTML5 audio/video to MP4 filter** should be placed at least before filters **Convert URLs into links and images** and **Multimedia plugins**.
